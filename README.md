Planner is an engineer who thrives on research optimization! Every second that can be spent on looking for another URL is a blessing. Because he likes optimization, he's a close friend of Keeper and can look directly in its vault.

## Usage

Planner is the Crawlis module that is looking into the URL database managed by Keeper. Then it selects the next URLs to be crawled and send them to a NATS instance.
